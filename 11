Dear Team,

Please note that the auto batch select query is not executing properly when we run it manually or through the scheduled auto batches.

Note:
The DB update queries are still pending on some systems. Every day, the issue gets resolved only after closing and reopening the database. Otherwise, we need to send a mail to the GAPI team each time to proceed.

This is just to inform everyone about the current situation and the reason for the issue.
