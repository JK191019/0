Subject: KT Document for Auto Cancellation Functionality

Dear Teja,

Regarding the KT document for the Auto Cancellation functionality, I would like to clarify that there is very limited information to include, as the logic is straightforward.

The Auto Cancellation works based on a simple condition:

1st The DUE_DT_CONTRACT < SYASTMDATE then PSO Tema will run two .sh files the files are 
1./TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_normal.sh 2./TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_cross.sh so then the trasaction avilabule in the Meruquring after Merqury the trasaction will avilabule in the Auto clarification Beach for the sql condiation  C_TRX_STATUS='M' AND BAL_FRGN_AMT > 0 AND CAN_FLG='3' AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME IN ('Book_FC_BRU','Booking_FC_DEO','DLIVERY_BRU','DLIVERY_DEO','FWCO_CANCEL_BRU','MANUAL_CNLDEO_TF','FWCO_FC_RFO','Sub_CE_15TF')AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME &lt;&gt; 'autocanTF'AND T_SYS_REL_TIME = TRUNC(SYSDATE) 


and TASK js i am writing the code once you check the TASK.js will undarstabule.


then the transaction will automatically fall under the Auto Cancellation queue.

Since this is the only condition involved, there is not much detailed content to provide in the KT document.

I will be giving the KT to @Nerella Rahul, and if you need any additional details or clarifications,

Please let me know if you need anything else.

note: i am working the AUTO cancilation only i alarady giving all the input i kwon the for this CR i all give to @Nerella Rahul if you have any exatar calarty i will provide in the KT session.

Regards,
Jithendra Kolusu.
