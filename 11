Dear Teja,

The Auto Cancelation for no need KT docmmants needed I larady to to what i know i am givin the KT for @NERELLA RAHUL if you want any thing I will tell you on KT secetion.

Subject: KT Document for Auto Cancellation Functionality

Dear Teja,

Regarding the KT document for the Auto Cancellation functionality, I would like to clarify that there is very limited information to include, as the logic is straightforward.

The Auto Cancellation works based on a simple condition:
	•	If can_flag = 3 and
	•	The balance ≥ 0,

then the transaction will automatically fall under the Auto Cancellation queue.

Since this is the only condition involved, there is not much detailed content to provide in the KT document.

I will be giving the KT to @Nerella Rahul, and if you need any additional details or clarifications, I will be happy to explain them during the KT session.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,
[Your Name]
