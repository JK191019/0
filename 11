Subject: KT Document for Auto Cancellation Functionality

Dear Teja,

Regarding the KT document for the Auto Cancellation functionality, I would like to clarify that there is very limited information to include, as the logic is straightforward.

The Auto Cancellation works based on a simple condition:

1st The DUE_DT_CONTRACT < SYASTMDATE then PSO Tema will run two .sh files the files are 
1./TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_normal.sh 2./TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_cross.sh so then the trasaction avilabule in the Meruquring after Merqury the trasaction will avilabule in the Auto clarification Beach for the sql condiation  C_TRX_STATUS='M' AND BAL_FRGN_AMT > 0 AND CAN_FLG='3' AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME IN ('Book_FC_BRU','Booking_FC_DEO','DLIVERY_BRU','DLIVERY_DEO','FWCO_CANCEL_BRU','MANUAL_CNLDEO_TF','FWCO_FC_RFO','Sub_CE_15TF')AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME &lt;&gt; 'autocanTF'AND T_SYS_REL_TIME = TRUNC(SYSDATE) 


and TASK js i am writing the code once you check the TASK.js will undarstabule.


then the transaction will automatically fall under the Auto Cancellation queue.

Since this is the only condition involved, there is not much detailed content to provide in the KT document.

I will be giving the KT to @Nerella Rahul, and if you need any additional details or clarifications,

Please let me know if you need anything else.

note: i am working the AUTO cancilation only i alarady giving all the input i kwon the for this CR i all give to @Nerella Rahul if you have any exatar calarty i will provide in the KT session.

Regards,
Jithendra Kolusu.




Subject: Re: KT Document for CRS and Auto-Cancellation Batch Process

Dear Teja,

Regarding the KT document for the CRS work and the Auto-Cancellation batch process in Forward Contract, I would like to clarify that the Auto Cancellation logic is straightforward and works the same way as the old functionality.

Below is the complete logic involved:

1. Auto-Cancellation Batch Trigger

If DUE_DT_CONTRACT < SYSDATE, then the PSO team will run the following two .sh files:
	1.	/TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_normal.sh
	2.	/TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_cross.sh

After running these scripts, the transaction becomes available in the Merging queue.
Once the merging is completed, the transaction will appear in the Auto Cancellation batch based on the SQL condition below.

2. Auto-Cancellation SQL Condition

A transaction enters the Auto-Cancellation queue if:

C_TRX_STATUS = 'M'
AND BAL_FRGN_AMT > 0
AND CAN_FLG = '3'
AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME IN 
('Book_FC_BRU','Booking_FC_DEO','DLIVERY_BRU','DLIVERY_DEO',
 'FWCO_CANCEL_BRU','MANUAL_CNLDEO_TF','FWCO_FC_RFO','Sub_CE_15TF')
AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME <> 'autocanTF'
AND T_SYS_REL_TIME = TRUNC(SYSDATE)

3. TASK.js

I have written the required logic in TASK.js.
Once you review the TASK.js file, the flow will be clear.

Since these are the only conditions involved in Auto Cancellation, there isn’t much more content to include in a detailed KT document.

I will provide the KT to @Nerella Rahul, and if you need any further clarification, I can explain everything during the KT session.

Note: I am working only on Auto Cancellation. All the inputs I have for this CR have already been shared with @Nerella Rahul.
If you need any extra clarity, I will provide it during the KT session.

Kindly let me know your available timing for the KT session.

Regards,
Jithendra Kolusu
