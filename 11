Dear sir,

The Capabilty matrics validation is done in 87 Region kindly arraange for the 


testing

Dear Sir,

The Capability Matrix validation has been completed in the 87 Region. Kindly arrange for the testing at your earliest convenience.




Dear Team,

The GAPI is not posting consistently and is currently not working in the 87 region. This issue is making testing very difficult, as we have to send emails each time and wait for a response.

Note: Since yesterday, the GAPI posting has completely stopped working. I have checked multiple times and already sent several emails regarding this issue. Kindly resolve this as soon as possible (ASAP).

@Suresh Nallala, I am unable to provide evidence at this moment because the issue occurs with multiple entries. Once the problem is fixed, I will recheck all GAPI entries and vouchers and provide the required evidence.
