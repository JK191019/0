Dear Jithendra,

Kindly share the KT document for your current work on the CRS  and the auto-cancellation batch process in the forward contract.
Also, Kindly arrange a KT session and share the available timings.


Subject: KT Document for Auto Cancellation Functionality

Dear Teja,

Regarding the KT document for the Auto Cancellation functionality, I would like to clarify that there is very limited information to include, as the logic is straightforward.

The Auto Cancellation works based on a simple condition:

1st The DUE_DT_CONTRACT < SYASTMDATE then PSO Tema will run two .sh files the files are 
1./TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_normal.sh 2./TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_cross.sh so then the trasaction avilabule in the Meruquring after Merqury the trasaction will avilabule in the Auto clarification Beach for the sql condiation  C_TRX_STATUS='M' AND BAL_FRGN_AMT > 0 AND CAN_FLG='3' AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME IN ('Book_FC_BRU','Booking_FC_DEO','DLIVERY_BRU','DLIVERY_DEO','FWCO_CANCEL_BRU','MANUAL_CNLDEO_TF','FWCO_FC_RFO','Sub_CE_15TF')AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME &lt;&gt; 'autocanTF'AND T_SYS_REL_TIME = TRUNC(SYSDATE) 


and TASK js i am writing the code once you check the TASK.js will undarstabule.


then the transaction will automatically fall under the Auto Cancellation queue.

Since this is the only condition involved, there is not much detailed content to provide in the KT document.

I will be giving the KT to @Nerella Rahul, and if you need any additional details or clarifications,

Please let me know if you need anything else.

note: i am working the AUTO cancilation only i alarady giving all the input i kwon the for this CR i all give to @Nerella Rahul if you have any exatar calarty i will provide in the KT session.

Regards,
Jithendra Kolusu.




Subject: Re: KT Document for CRS and Auto-Cancellation Batch Process

Dear Teja,

Regarding the KT document for the CRS work and the Auto-Cancellation batch process in Forward Contract, I would like to clarify that the Auto Cancellation logic is straightforward and works the same way as the old functionality.

Below is the complete logic involved:

1. Auto-Cancellation Batch Trigger

If DUE_DT_CONTRACT < SYSDATE, then the PSO team will run the following two .sh files:
	1.	/TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_normal.sh
	2.	/TFEEAPP/base_domain/Reports/SrcScripts/auto_can_cross.sh

After running these scripts, the transaction becomes available in the Merging queue.
Once the merging is completed, the transaction will appear in the Auto Cancellation batch based on the SQL condition below.

2. Auto-Cancellation SQL Condition

A transaction enters the Auto-Cancellation queue if:

C_TRX_STATUS = 'M'
AND BAL_FRGN_AMT > 0
AND CAN_FLG = '3'
AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME IN 
('Book_FC_BRU','Booking_FC_DEO','DLIVERY_BRU','DLIVERY_DEO',
 'FWCO_CANCEL_BRU','MANUAL_CNLDEO_TF','FWCO_FC_RFO','Sub_CE_15TF')
AND C_FUNC_SHORT_NAME <> 'autocanTF'
AND T_SYS_REL_TIME = TRUNC(SYSDATE)

3. TASK.js

I have written the required logic in TASK.js.
Once you review the TASK.js file, the flow will be clear.

Since these are the only conditions involved in Auto Cancellation, there isn’t much more content to include in a detailed KT document.

I will provide the KT to @Nerella Rahul, and if you need any further clarification, I can explain everything during the KT session.

Note: I am working only on Auto Cancellation. All the inputs I have for this CR have already been shared with @Nerella Rahul.
If you need any extra clarity, I will provide it during the KT session.

Kindly let me know your available timing for the KT session.

Regards,
Jithendra Kolusu

✅ What is a Forward Contract (FWC / FWCO) in Trade Finance?

A Forward Contract (FWC) is an agreement between a customer (exporter/importer) and the bank (like SBI) to buy or sell foreign currency at a fixed rate on a future date.

👉 Why?

To protect the customer from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

👉 Used By:
	•	Exporters (who will receive foreign currency later)
	•	Importers (who need to pay foreign currency later)

👉 In SBI Systems:
	•	FWCO = Forward Contract – Outgoing / Forward Contract Booking
	•	FWCI = Forward Contract – Incoming / Forward Utilization

Some banks use slightly different codes, but SBI’s trade finance system uses FWCO for booking.

⸻

🎯 Example (SBI – Forward Contract Booking)

Case: Importer example

ABC Importers (India) need to pay USD 100,000 to a supplier after 3 months.

Current USD/INR = ₹84.20

But they worry the rate may go to 86 or 87.

They go to SBI and book a forward contract:
	•	Type: FWCO
	•	Amount: USD 100,000
	•	Tenor: 3 months (value date)
	•	Rate fixed: ₹84.50 (Bank gives forward premium)

Now the importer is protected — no matter market rate goes up, SBI must give USD at ₹84.50.

⸻

🎯 Example (Exporters)

XYZ Exporter will receive USD 50,000 after 2 months.

Market rate today: ₹84.20
They worry USD may fall to 82 or 81 later.

They book FWCO with SBI:
	•	Amount: USD 50,000
	•	Tenor: 2 months
	•	Rate fixed: ₹84.30

Now exporter is protected from loss.

⸻

🧾 How SBI Handles Forward Contracts Internally

In SBI Trade Finance (and similar bank software):

1️⃣ Booking (FWCO)
	•	Customer requests contract
	•	Bank checks limits (LC limit, FBP/FBD limit, FX exposure)
	•	Bank fixes forward rate
	•	Contract booked with a unique Forward Contract Number
	•	LIEN marked on the customer’s FX limit
	•	Accounting entries passed

2️⃣ Utilization (FWCI)

Whenever:
	•	Import bill comes for payment
	•	Export bill is purchased/realized

Bank uses (utilizes) part or full of the forward contract.

3️⃣ Cancellation

If customer doesn’t use the contract, SBI cancels it.

Cancellation requires:
	•	Rebooking rate difference
	•	Cancellation charge
	•	Swap cost depending on market

4️⃣ Extension / Rollover

If customer needs extension, SBI rebooks with new maturity date.

⸻

🏦 SBI Example – How it looks in Bank System

✔ Final Summary (Very Simple)

Forward Contract (FWCO) = Agreement with SBI to lock a fixed foreign exchange rate for future payment/receipt to avoid loss due to rate fluctuation.

⸻

If you want, Boss, I can also explain:

✅ Forward contract booking flow in banks
✅ Accounting entries used in SBI trade finance
✅ How auto-cancellation works
✅ How margin / exposure is calculated
✅ Difference between Option, Forward, and Swap
