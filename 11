Dear Team,

The GAPI is not posting consistently and is currently not working in the 87 region. It’s becoming very difficult to perform testing, as we have to send emails every time and wait for a response.

I have been checking since morning, and it’s still not working. Please refer to the attached screenshot for reference. This issue is causing repeated delays in our testing activities.

@Suresh Nallala, kindly intervene and help resolve this issue, as we have been facing it multiple times in the 87 region.
